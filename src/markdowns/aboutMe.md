Hi! I'm Andrew, a student studying computer science at Carleton University. I am passionate about creating software and learning new skills.
I am currently focused on improving my embedded programming skills and passing my exams ðŸ˜…. My plan for this website is to eventually host some program running Web Assembly here. I will be taking up a software developer coop position at <ins>[Ross Video](https://www.rossvideo.com/)</ins> for the summer of 2022 and may be available for hire for the following fall term.
