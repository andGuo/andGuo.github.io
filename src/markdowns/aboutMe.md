Hello there, my name is Andrew and I am a computer science student in the honours program with a concentration in artificial intelligence and machine learning at Carleton University. I am also completing a double minor in Law and Business which I plan on completing abroad in the autumn of 2024. I am currently working part-time for the Public Health Agency of Canada as a Junior Full Stack Developer.
